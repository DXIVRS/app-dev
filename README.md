## Synopsis: 
Miyuki Shirogane and Kaguya Shinomiya are the student body's top representatives at the prestigious Shuchiin Academy. Miyuki is the student council president and is regarded as the best student in the country by both peers and mentors. Along with him, vice president Kaguya—the eldest daughter of the rich Shinomiya family—performs admirably in every profession imaginable. They are regarded as the ideal couple by the entire student body.

Despite the fact that both have affections for the other, neither is willing to admit it. The first to admit defeat will be looked down upon and regarded the inferior. Miyuki and Kaguya are both equally motivated to be the one to emerge triumphant on the battlefield of love, with their honor and pride at stake!
